## The game comes in 7 different versions or "phases":

  * Phase 0: No actual "game" is played in this particular phase. The only thing that occurs is that three establishment cards (*Wheat Field*, *Ranch*, *Forest*) and one landmark card (*City Hall*) are displayed on the console.

  * Phase 1: In the Phase 1 version of the game, the only cards in play are the ones described above in Phase 0. The *City Hall* costs 7 coins to construct. All players start with a single *Wheat Field*, and there are 6 of each of the three establishments in the market. The first player to complete the *City Hall* wins the game.
