## The game comes in 7 different versions or "phases":

  * Phase 0: No actual "game" is played in this particular phase. The only thing that occurs is that three establishment cards (*Wheat Field*, *Ranch*, *Forest*) and one landmark card (*City Hall*) are displayed on the console.

  * Phase 1: In the Phase 1 version of the game, the only cards in play are the ones described above in Phase 0. The *City Hall* costs 7 coins to construct. The *City Hall* landmark is not an official game card. It is only temporary for this particular phase so that players can get a sense of how the game works. All players start with a single *Wheat Field*, and there are 6 of each of the three establishments in the market. The first player to complete the *City Hall* wins the game.

## Objectives
The main goal of this game is to collect coins and purchase establishments in order to construct landmarks. When a player has constructed all landmarks in a particular phase, the player has won the game. To collect coins, a player would want to stock up on establishment cards and hope that when dice are rolled, it would activate some of their cards. When a card is activated, a player can collect coins from the bank or from another player, depending on the card's action. The more establishment cards a player has, the greater potential there is for coin return. Landmarks do not have to be constructed in any particular order. The player turns rotates in a clock wise order, and will continue to circle around until the game has a winner.

## Current Game State
The current market state and the current player states are displayed at the start of every game, as well as after each player turn. An example of a market state is as follows:

    ******************************************
                      MARKET                  
    ------------------------------------------
    Bakery             GB (1)  [2-3]    #5

    Family Restaurant  RU (3)  [9-10]   #3
    Apple Orchard      BW (3)  [10]     #2

The current market state holds every establishment that is up for grabs. The name of the card is first, followed by a two letter abbreviation where the first letter represents the color and the second letter represents the icon of the card. The number inside parenthesis is the cost of the card. The square brackets hold the activation number/s. Lastly, the number after the hash symbol is the available number of that particular card.

Following the current market state are the player states. An example of a player state for each player is presented as followed:

    ******************************************

The current player state holds every establishment and the number of coins a player has, followed by a list of landmarks in which a player has or has not constructed. At the leftmost part of every line listed on the player state is the name of the card, followed by a two letter abbreviation where the first letter represents the color of the card and the second letter represents the icon of the card. Following those two letters is a number inside parentheses, which represents the cost of the card. Followed by the cost inside the square brackets is the activation number/range. Lastly, the number right after the hash symbol represents the number available of that particular card. Below are the landmarks, and are either marked empty or with an 'X' inside the square brackets, depending on whether the player has constructed the landmark or not.

## Purchase Menu
After a player has rolled the dice, a prompt will show up if any cards are activated for the players participating, and coins will be distributed accordingly. Next, the active player will get the opportunity to buy an establishment or construct a landmark listed in the purchase menu. An example of a purchase menu is presented as followed:

    Player 1, would you like to purchase an   
    establishment or construct a landmark? (27 
    coins)                                    
    (To view details of an item, type 'view'  
    followed by the item number. For example, 
    to view item 6, type 'view 6'.)

    99. Do nothing                            
    ========================================== 
    Choose a number to purchase or construct: 

The active player will get a reminder of how many coins he has in his possesion. Only establishments and landmarks will be on the purchase menu that a player can afford and is allowed to purchase. A player can also choose to view a card if before making his decision if he pleases. Even though a player has purchasing options, he can still choose not to make any improvements and enter 99, and then the turn will go to the next player. 

## Rules
* A player may only purchase one establishment or construct one landmark in each turn.
* If a card is activated that has the action to take coins from another player, but the player does not have the amount required to pay, he will then pay the remaining amount he has. 
* A player can choose to roll 1 or 2 dice during his turn.
* A player must always wait until his turn is up to purchase an establishment or construct a landmark.

## Random AI
Except for Phase 0, there is an option to play against a random AI instead of a human player. The random AI traverses the game by making uniform random choices when given an option. To play with a Random AI, type **--ai** in the terminal.
